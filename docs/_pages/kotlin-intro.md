# What is Kotlin?

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a multi-purpose programming language that runs in the JVM.  In many ways, it's what Java would have been had it been designed 20 years later.  

Kotlin code is much more concise than the equivalent Java.  It has native features that address many of the gripes that programmers have about Java, including the following:

1. Null safety is built-in.
1. Fields are implemented as `Properties` that include default (but configurable) getters and setters.
1. The ability to add methods and fields to classes without formally extending them.
1. Semicolons are optional!
1. Automatic inference of data types when declaring Variables
1. Default values in method signatures, reducing the need to overload methods.

Kotlin is 100% compatible with Java, so you can freely use any libraries that are written in or for Java.  With a few caveats, you can also call all of you Kotlin code from Java.  You can even mix Kotlin in with Java in the same project!  

Of course, Kotlin works really well with JavaFX.  In fact, JavaFX is way better with Kotlin than it is with Java.
