# Introduction

# What is Gradle?

Gradle is a build automation tool.  It does a lot of work for you that you would have to otherwise do yourself, and it's agnostic towards whatever environment you run it from.  This means that you can run it integrated with your IDE, from a server like Hudson/Jenkins or from a command line and it will work consistently from each one.  

Like Maven, you can use Gradle to manage the dependencies for your project.  This means that you don't have to download Jar files, and set them up as libraries in your IDE.  

Gradle will also manage your tests, and run your test suite every time it builds your project.

Unlike Maven or ANT, Gradle uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to configure how it runs.  This means that you're writing snippets of code instead of configuring XML documents or scripts.  At first, it doesn't feel like you're writing code, but once you get the hang of it you can do lots of cool things because you are writing code.

# Getting Started?

Primarily here, I'm going to talk about using Gradle with Intellij Idea, but the principles are going to be the same if you're using Eclipse or NetBeans.  If you're using VSCode you should stop that right now, download [Intellij Idea Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and become a much happier programmer.  

Intellij allows you to configure Gradle as the build engine it uses compiling and running both your production and test code:

![Screen Snap 1]({{page.ScreenSnap1}})

You can see that in a Gradle project, that Gradle is the default for compiling and running, not the internal Intellij engine.  

So how do you make a Gradle project?  In Intellij Idea, it's an option in the `New -> Project...` dialog:

![ScreenSnap2]({{page.ScreenSnap2}})

And then you get your new project, already set up to use Gradle as a build engine. In this screen, aside from the specifics about what you're going to name your project, you'll need to pick a language for Gradle to use and the version of the JDK that you want to use to run Gradle itself.  It's probably best to stick with a fairly current version of the JDK, and if you're not a Kotlin programmer you should stick to Groovy.

The most important things that this will do, from a Gradle configuration perspective, will be to create two files. The first file is `settings.gradle`:

```
rootProject.name = "GradleDemo1"
```

The `settings.gradle` file becomes much more important if you're going to create a multi level project with sub-projects.  Otherwise, this one line is all you'll generally need.


The other file is `gradle.build`:

``` groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id 'org.javamodularity.moduleplugin' version '1.8.12'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
    id 'org.beryx.jlink' version '2.25.0'
}

group 'ca.pragmaticcoding'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

ext {
    junitVersion = '5.9.1'
}

sourceCompatibility = '17'
targetCompatibility = '17'

tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.encoding = 'UTF-8'
}

application {
    mainModule = 'ca.pragmaticcoding.gradledemo1'
    mainClass = 'ca.pragmaticcoding.gradledemo1.HelloApplication'
}

javafx {
    version = '17.0.2'
    modules = ['javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml']
}

dependencies {
    implementation('org.kordamp.ikonli:ikonli-javafx:12.3.1')

    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:${junitVersion}")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:${junitVersion}")
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}

jlink {
    imageZip = project.file("${buildDir}/distributions/app-${javafx.platform.classifier}.zip")
    options = ['--strip-debug', '--compress', '2', '--no-header-files', '--no-man-pages']
    launcher {
        name = 'app'
    }
}

jlinkZip {
    group = 'distribution'
}
```

# The Basics of gradle.build

Looking at this file, it doesn't look much like code.  It's actually a language called "Groovy".  Groovy is a superset of Java, so if you already know Java then you can automatically write Groovy - since all Java is Groovy.  And you can do that here, just write stuff in Java and it'll work just fine.  Groovy has a it's own stuff too, and most of what you'll see in `gradle.build` takes advantage of that.  For instance, you won't see and semi-colons at the ends of the line because they're optional in Groovy.

Finally, Groovy is used here as the basis for a Domain Specific Language (DSL).  What this means is that this is actually a script, with additional rules and context, but the actual lines of code are Groovy.  In order to understand what this is doing, you have to understand the context that this code runs in.  

And that's what we're going to look at here.

## Plugins

Gradle has a base set of functionality, and then it has the ability to incorporate plugins for doing other specific things.  One of those base functionalities is the ability to load in plugins!  See how that works?

That's what the "plugins" section does:

``` groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id 'org.javamodularity.moduleplugin' version '1.8.12'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
    id 'org.beryx.jlink' version '2.25.0'
}
```
What these lines do is to call `PluginDependencySpec.id(String id)`.  In Groovy, you don't need the brackets for the single parameter.  The result of this method call will be to return some kind of object, but more importantly, it will load the plugin so that it can be used in your build.  

The other thing to note is that the object returned from `PluginDependencySpec.id(String id)` has methods, and one of those methods is `version(String version)`.  Groovy allows infix notation, so you don't have `.` between the calls, and once again, you don't need the brackets.  

You don't need to understand all of this, the main take-away is that you specify your plugins by name, and for some you need to specify a version number.  Use the format that you see is already used.

In this project we're loading in the `java` plugin and the `application` plugin, both of which are considered "core" plugins.  The [java](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html) plugin adds compilation, testing and bundling for...Java!  The [application](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html) plugin adds the capabilities required for creating an executable JVM application.  Pretty much, you're always going to use these two plugins.  

The other 3 plugins are things you may or may not need to use.  Intellij decided they wanted to default to a modular project, sowe have the plugin for that, and the `jlink` plugin for creating "fat" jars.  Finally, since I specified a JavaFX project, we have the plugin for JavaFX.

Plugins bring along with them a set of "tasks" which they enable.  For instance, the `java` plugin defines `compileJava`, `jar`, `test` and `clean` amongst others.  The `application` plugin supplies `run`.

You can view the tasks in the "Gradle" section in Intellij:

![Gradle Task Menu]({{page.ScreenSnap3}})

You can see that `application` has brought the `run` task, and you can also see `build` and `clean` in the "build" section.

## Project Properties

We have the following lines in our `build.gradle` file:

``` groovy
group 'ca.pragmaticcoding'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
```
These are "properties" of our Gradle project object.  "Group" is something that you've probably encountered if you've looked at Maven style dependencies, and basically indicates the top level ownership of the project.  "Version" goes at the other end of the identifier.  Squashed in the middle is the project name.  

Altogether, the build from this project will be identified as:

```
ca.pragmaticcoding:GradleDemo1:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

It's a convention to use `-SNAPSHOT` for work-in-progress builds, in between official releases.  If you were publishing this to some place like MavenCentral, then people would know that this was updated frequently and not necessarily ready for production use.  

Talking about MavenCentral, we also have the following sections in our `build.gradle` file.

``` groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation('org.kordamp.ikonli:ikonli-javafx:12.3.1')

    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:${junitVersion}")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:${junitVersion}")
}
```

First, we have `repositories` which returns a handler for adding external repositories for dependencies.  There are methods defined for some of the most popular repositories, and also some for searching in local directories.  

Then we have the `dependencies` section.  This is where you actually declare what external libraries you'll be using.  The first part of the dependency declaration is the most complicated.  What are `implementation`, `testImplementation` and `testRuntimeOnly`?

These are standard "configurations" declared by the Java plugin.  In a nutshell, these configurations tell Gradle where the dependencies need to be available: for compiling, for runtime, or for both.  Roughly speaking, they are closely related to the idea of classpaths.  The `implementation` configuration means "both".  That's what you'll need more than anything else.  We'll look at the `test...` stuff in a bit.  

The stuff in the brackets is the Maven style name of the dependency library in the format `Group:Artifact:Version`.  Gradle will automatically go look for the library in the repositories listed in the `repositories` section.  

It's actually really easy to get the format for these.  Let's look at that `ikonli` library (Which is a library to use FontAwesome icons in JavaFX).  First thing, Google this:

```
maven ikonli
```

Right near the top, you should see this [link](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kordamp.ikonli). On that page will be a list of different libraries related to Ikonli.  We're interested in the [ikonli-javafx](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kordamp.ikonli/ikonli-javafx) library.  Click on that, and you'll come to a page with all of the different versions of the libarary that have been released.  

For this project, we just want the latest version, which is [12.3.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kordamp.ikonli/ikonli-javafx/12.3.1).  So if you click on that, you'll get to a page with some information, and a tab pane with tabs like "Maven", "Gradle" and "Gradle (Short)".  Click on the "Gradle" tab and you'll see the long form dependency declaration:

![Maven Central]({{page.ScreenSnap4}})

You can just click in that box with the declaration, and it should copy it to your clipboard.  Then you can paste it into your `build.gradle` file.  The long form is fine, but you can use the short form, and the Kotlin version is the one that has the brackets and it works too.

# Source Sets and Directories

A really simplistic view of what Gradle does is to take your project files - your Java code, stylesheets and resources - create compiled class files and then bundle them up with some or all of your other files into some place where they can be put into a Jar file.  If you look at it that way, then a lot of what Gradle does is simple to understand.  We're going to talk about this in the context of a Java project, so some of these ideas are global Gradle concepts, and some come from the Java plugin.  It's probably not going to matter to you what's what with that.  

The first thing we need to understand is where Gradle finds your project files.  To do this, it imposes a file structure on you.  The first thing is that you get a top level directory called "src" and two directories below it: "main" and "test".  These are called "Source Sets", and are further broken down into "java" and "resources".

If you've been following along, you've probably noticed that you don't have "test" your your Intellij project.  However, if you go to the "src" level of your project, right click and pick "New -> Directory", you'll get the following window:

![Screen Shot]({{page.ScreenSnap5}})

Intellij knows about them, and even tells you that they're "Gradle Source Sets".  You can highlight both and then hit <Enter> and it'll add them for you.

The "Test" and "Main" source sets are handled differently.  Anything in the "Main" source set is going to ordinarily end up in your Jar file, while the "Test" source set should contain (in our case) JUnit tests.  You can't run the tests without compiling the "Main" source set as well, so the Gradle configuration for tests is said to "extend" the main configuration.  

If you open up the Gradle menu, go into the "build" submenu and double click on "build", then Gradle will build your project.  Now, you'll have a top level "build" directory in your project.  This is the output directory where everything goes.  

Now we can talk about the configurations `testImplementation` and `testRuntimeOnly`.  These are configurations related to the 'Test' source set, and relate to when the dependencies are needed.  The `testImplementation` configuration puts the libraries on the classpath for both compilation and for execution of the code.  The other one puts the libraries on the classpath for execution of the tests only.  

It's possible to add more source sets to your project to do different things.  For instance, you may have code that performs some special purpose, and you only want to include it in certain circumstances.  You can put that into a separate source set.  It's also possible to do some pretty complicated things about how files are copied from your source sets into the "build" directory - but that's beyond the scope of this article.

# Extra Properties

In our `build.gradle` file we have this:

``` groovy
ext {
    junitVersion = '5.9.1'
}
```

The `ext` section is a shorthand to define properties in an object called `project.ext`.  This is where you put "extra" data that you want to be available throughout your project.  In this case, we're defining `project.ext.junitVersion`.  One of cool things about this is that you don't need to put in the `project.ext.` when you refer to it.  

Now you should understand this a bit better:

``` groovy
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:${junitVersion}")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:${junitVersion}")
}
```
The `${}` stuff is a way to inject the values of variables into a `String` expression.  This is going to make the first value:  "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.9.1".  And it's easier to maintain our build file if we want to move to a newer version of JUnit.
