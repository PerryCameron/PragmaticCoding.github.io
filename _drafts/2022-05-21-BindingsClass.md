# Introduction

Bindings are the "meat and potatoes" of Reactive JavaFX application design.  They are the basic mechanism that allows you to link your View to a Presentation Model so that changes in the View are instantly reflected in your data and visa versa.

There are three techniques to create Bindings in JavaFX:

## First, Some Nomenclature:

This can get a little bit confusing. The word "bindings" is used in so many different ways here, that we need to make sure that everyone understands what that word means when it's used in this article:

"Binding" the Action
: We're going to talk a lot about binding things together.  It will always be used in lower case (unless it's the first word in a sentence), and will always be used like a verb.

"Binding" the Result
: When you bind to properties together, the thing that joins them is a binding.  As long as we're not talking about a specific class of Binding I'll refer to it as "a binding", "the binding" or "the bindings".   I'll use lower case and no fancy formatting.

"Binding" the Classes
: There are a number of binding classes.  These are things like `IntegerBinding`, `BooleanBinding` and so on.  These specific classes are pretty clear, but when talking about them in general I'll be consistent in referring to them as,"Binding",  "a `Binding`" or, "the `Binding`", "the `Bindings`" so that you'll were talking in general about an example of one of those classes.

"Bindings"the Library
: The subject of this article.  It will always be referred to as `Bindings`, or perhaps "the `Bindings` class".

# Understand Custom Bindings First

The best way to understand what bindings are and how they work is to look at how to create custom `Binding` classes.   

# What is the "Bindings" Class?

The Bindings class is a utility library consisting of around 200 static methods that create or manipulate Bindings.  I've made an effort divide them up into a number of different types, and we'll look at these with examples of how they can be used.

# The "Create" Methods

Possibly the most useful methods are the "Create" methods, and there are 7 of them.  One for each of the most common Property types you might use.  So we have `createBooleanBinding()`, `createStringBinding` and so on.  Let's look at `createStringBinding()` as an example.  The method signature looks like this:

``` java
static StringBinding 	createStringBindingâ€‹(Callable<String> func, Observable... dependencies)
```
Obviously, it's a static method and it retuns a `StringBinding`.  The first parameter is a `Callable` that returns a `String`.  

What's `Callable`?

`Callable` is a Functional Interface which is virtually identical to `Supplier`, except that it's single method is `call()` instead of `get()`.  It's a method that takes no parameters and returns a value - in this case a `String`.  Since it's a Functional Interface, it can be implemented via a lambda function or a method reference.  Unfortunately, they chose to call this parameter `func`, which is really confusing for beginners.  It's not a `Function`.

Now it's a parameter to `createStringBinding()`, which means that you have to create a `Callable<String>` and pass it to this method.  Before we look at this more closely, we'll take a look at the remaining parameters.

The next parameter is `Observable...`, which means that it's a vararg, and you can pass it as many arguments as you like, just so long as they are all Observable types.  It calls these parameters, `dependencies`, which is  a good clue as to what they do.

At this point, I'm going to suggest that you look at my article on custom `Bindings` one last time, because the rest of this explanation relies on it.

With a custom `Binding`, you need to specify two things.  The first is an implementation of `computeValue()`, which is a method which takes no parameters and returns a value - and for a custom `StringBinding`, that would be a `String`.  

You can probably see that `computeValue()` just about fits the definition of how `Callable<String>` works.  And that's exactly what it is.  However you define that `Callable<String>`, it's going to function **exactly** the same way that `computeValue()` would in a Custom Binding.

The second thing you need to do with a custom `Binding` is to make a call to `super.bind()` in its constructor.  This establishes the dependencies for the `Binding`.  And you'll notice that this second parameter just happens to be called, "dependencies".  What a coincidence!

Now you can see that `createStringBinding()` is really just a short-hand way to create a custom Binding in a single line of code.  I find that I very rarely create custom Binding classes manually, especially as anonymous inner classes, because it's just so much easier to use one of these `Bindings` methods.  It looks cleaner too.

Every suggestion I make about custom Bindings holds true for any Bindings created via these methods.  Make sure that you call the `get()` method of each of the `dependencies` in your `func` parameter, just as you would in `computeValue()`

### An Example

``` java
public class BindingsCLassDemo1 extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 620, 340);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private int divisor = 1;

    private Region createContent() {
        ObjectProperty<Integer> number1 = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(100);
        ObjectProperty<Integer> number2 = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(30);
        BooleanProperty evensOnly = new SimpleBooleanProperty(false);
        Label label1 = new Label();
        label1.textProperty().bind(number1.asString());
        Label label2 = new Label();
        label2.textProperty().bind(number2.asString());
        Label results = new Label();
        results.textProperty().bind(Bindings.createStringBinding(() -> calculateAmountAsString(number1, number2, evensOnly), number1, number2, evensOnly));
        HBox labelBox = new HBox(10,
                new Label("Number 1:"), label1,
                new Label("Number2: "), label2,
                new Label("Results: "), results);
        Button button1 = new Button("Increase Value 1");
        button1.setOnAction(evt -> number1.set(number1.get() + 1));
        Button button2 = new Button("Increase Value 2");
        button2.setOnAction(evt -> number2.set(number2.get() + 1));
        CheckBox checkBox = new CheckBox("Evens Only");
        evensOnly.bind(checkBox.selectedProperty());
        HBox controlBox = new HBox(5, button1, button2, checkBox);
        VBox vBox = new VBox(40, labelBox, controlBox);
        vBox.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        return vBox;
    }

    private String calculateAmountAsString(ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property1, ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property2, ObservableBooleanValue evenOnly) {
        int result = (property1.get() + property2.get()) / divisor;
        System.out.println("computing " + property1.get() + " " + property2.get() + " divisor: " + divisor + " result: " + result);
        divisor++;
        if (evenOnly.get()) {
            return Integer.toString(((result % 2) == 0) ? result : 0);
        }
        return Integer.toString(result);
    }

}
```

This is a bit goofy, and it certainly doesn't do anything too useful, but it does demonstrate all the key points you need to understand about the create methods in `Bindings`.  When it runs, it looks like this:

![Custom Binding Screenshot]({{page.custom_binding}})

and the console output looks like this:

```
computing 100 30 divisor: 1 result: 130
computing 100 30 divisor: 2 result: 65
computing 101 30 divisor: 3 result: 43
computing 102 30 divisor: 4 result: 33
computing 102 31 divisor: 5 result: 26
computing 102 32 divisor: 6 result: 22
computing 102 33 divisor: 7 result: 19
computing 102 33 divisor: 8 result: 16
computing 103 33 divisor: 9 result: 15
computing 104 33 divisor: 10 result: 13
computing 105 33 divisor: 11 result: 12
```

This example is very, very similar to the first example from the Custom Binding class tutorial, and the results should be identical to that example.

#### Which Method to Use

Here we are `Bindings.createStringBinding()` because we are going to bind the results to the `Text` property of a `Label`, which needs a `StringBinding`. This is useful here because is shows how we can handle the conversion from numbers to the correct type for the application right in the method call.

With the custom Binding example of this, we left the Binding as an `IntegerBinding` and then use the Fluent API method `asString()` to convert it to a `StringBinding`.  This made sense as the custom Binding was dealing with numbers and, as a stand-alone class, there isn't any context to suggest that the result should be anything other than some sort of numeric `Binding`.

In this case though, we're calling the `Bindings` method as part of the `.bind()` method call, meaning that the context is well defined.  We need a `StringBinding`, so we should use a method that returns that.

#### How it Works

The key point to remember here is that, just like with `computeValue()`, the code in the `Callable` parameter `func` is dealing with concrete data classes, not `Property` classes.  When it does deal with `Property` classes, it's just to extract the current value of the data that they contain via their `get()` or `getValue()` methods.  And the `Callable` returns a concrete data class, not a `Property` or `Observable`.  

This makes the code simpler, but it's also counter-intuitive and trips up a lot of beginners.

You should follow the general rules for using lambdas in any place.  Readability drops dramatically when they have more than one line.  So stick to expression lambdas (instead of statement lambdas), and call methods when your lambda gets too big.  That's what's happening here, so we've got a separate method to do the calculation.

This should underscore how close this is to a custom `Binding`:  To create this code, I just copy/pasted the `computeValue()` code from the custom Binding example I already had and renamed it to `calculateAmountAsString()`, and then inserted the parameter list from the custom Binding's constructor.  Some small modifications to add calls to `Integer.toString()` and it was all done.

### How Important Are These Methods?

These 7 methods can do just about anything you need to do.  The rest of the methods described in this tutorial... I don't use them too much myself.  For me, it's often just as clear to use `create{type}Binding()`, as it is to use any of the other methods in this library, and there's a little bit of extra consistency.  

Let's look at an example:

``` java
IntegerBinding binding = Bindings.createIntegerBinding(() -> propertyA.get() + propertyB.get(), propertyA, propertyB);
```

That's pretty clear.  The two values are just added together.  The alternative is:

``` java
NumberBinding binding = Bindings.add(propertyA, propertyB);
```

Which is, admittedly a little bit simpler.  However, if the requirements change and now it needs to be "average" instead of "sum".  Then the second example becomes:

``` java
NumberBinding binding = Bindings.divide(Bindings.add(propertyA, propertyB), 2);
```
or alternatly using the Fluent API:

``` java
NumberBinding binding = Bindings.add(propertyA, propertyB).divide(2);
```
Both of which start to become a little bit more complicated.  Now maybe this starts to become a better way:

``` java
IntegerBinding binding = Bindings.createIntegerBinding(() -> (propertyA.get() + propertyB.get())/2, propertyA, propertyB);
```
or possibly:

``` java
IntegerBinding binding = Bindings.createIntegerBinding(() -> findAverage(propertyA.get(),propertyB.get()), propertyA, propertyB);
```

Well... maybe not so much in this case, but you get the idea.  

Personally, I find that the Fluent API is great as long as the relationships and manipulations are simple and straight-forward.  But when it starts to get more complicated, the Fluent API makes it even more complicated.  When you find yourself scratching your head trying to figure out how to do something with the Fluent API, you probably should just stop and use `Bindings.create{type}Binding()` instead.

# The "Operation" Methods

This set of methods is aimed pretty squarely at the functionality provided through the Fluent API.  We have the following groups of operations:

## The "Manipulation" Methods

  1. Concat
  1. Format (for formatting Strings)
  1. Size (for Observable Lists)
  1. When



## The "Boolean" Methods

There's a set of methods that return a `BooleanBinding`:

  1. LessThan and GreaterThan (including ...OrEqual versions)
  1. IsEmpty and IsNotEmpty
  1. Equal and NotEqual
  1. And and Or

## The "Mathematical" Methods

There are a set of methods that return `DoubleBinding` or `NumberBinding` and perform mathematical operations on numbers and numeric ObservableValues:

  1. Max and Min
  1. Multiply and Divide
  1. Add and Substract


# The "Extraction" Methods

Sometimes you need to create a relationship between an `ObservableIntegerValue` and an `ObservableList` of some nature.  This is potentially tricky to do, but these methods make it relatively easy.

## List and Map Extractors

## Member Extractors

# The "Bind" Methods
