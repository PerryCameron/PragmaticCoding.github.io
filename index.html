I've been a professional programmer for all of my adult life, with my first real programming job back in 1985.  So I've been doing this for a long time.  Or at least it seems that way to me.

I was lucky enough to notice right at the beginning of my career that lots of IT departments struggle to succeed.  It's hard, and I made a conscious decision to pay attention and learn from the way that the people around me succeeded, and even more attention to how they failed.
For the past 35 years I've spent a lot of time thinking about how we think about building systems.

This blog is new and very much a work in progress.  Expect to see both technical articles and articles about programming in a business environment.
