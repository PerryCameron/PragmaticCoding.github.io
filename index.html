Hi!

<br><br>My name is Dave and I've been a professional programmer for all of my adult
life, with my first real programming job back in 1985.  Which means I've been
doing this for a long time, or at least it seems that way to me.

<br><br>Very early in my career, I noticed that lots of IT departments struggle
to succeed at software development.

<br><br>It's one of the most difficult things any company can try to do because software
development is almost always about exploration, investigation, innovation and
learning as you go.  Users rarely know what they want, certainly don't know what
is possible, and have trouble visualizing how software will work before it is
delivered.  Programmers, for their part, often have limited understanding of the
business and are usually expected to leverage new technologies they've never
used before to build working solutions.

<br><br> For the past 35 years I've spent a lot of time thinking about how we
think about building systems.

<br><br>This website is a place for me to share what I've learned about not just
programming, but the entire lifecyle of business applications - from the initial
idea to satisfy a business need, right through development and maintenance, to
the inevitable day when it's time to replace it with something newer and better.

<br><br> Since about 2014, I've spent a large amount of my professional time
developing desktop applications in JavaFX. There is a surprising lack on the web
right now of high quality information about how to use JavaFX properly, and I'm
hoping that my articles on this website about JavaFX will fill that hole.
