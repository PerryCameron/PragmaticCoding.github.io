# Using Sprites

<div style="display: table-cell;">
<img src="{{ page.headingImage }}"  width="230" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 6px; float:left;" />
<br>
Sprites are an old concept.  I remember that Commodore 64's and the Atari 800's in the early 1980's had the concept of Sprites included in their operating systems.  A Sprite is just stand-alone graphic element that can be independently manipulated within a larger image environment.
<br><br>
In the context of this tutorial, we're going to concentrate on the idea of a Sprite as an image container with a set of related images which are displayed within that container.  By rapidly changing the image displayed in the container, we can give the illusion of motion.

# Single Image Sprites

Nowadays, and especially where CSS and web pages are concerned, a Sprite is usually a single image which contains a number of related images.  For web design, this is a good technique as it avoids loading multiple images and improves page performance.  

For JavaFX, it can also handy.  As an example, let's look at a single image file containing a number of images for a running troll:

![Sprites]({{page.sprites}})

This is one of the trolls from the [CraftPix.net](https://craftpix.net/freebies/2d-game-troll-free-character-sprites/?utm_campaign=Website&utm_source=opengameart.org&utm_medium=public) free troll series.  I think they're pretty cool, and the images are actually huge, with lots of details.  The guy at the top of the page is another one of them.

It's important to note that your individual images all have to be the same size, and are positioned identically relative to each other, and regularly spaced out.  

To start with, let's just get the `Image` on the screen in an `ImageView`, then we can move on from there:

``` java
public class SpriteDemo1 extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createContent()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        BorderPane results = new BorderPane();
        ImageView sprite = new ImageView(this.getClass().getResource("Troll.png").toExternalForm());
        results.setCenter(sprite);
        return results;
    }
}
```

Which yields this:
![ScreenShot 1]({{page.screenshot1}})

Okay, now we have the image loaded properly.  It's always a good idea to start off super simple, that way you know you don't have problems locating the resources or anything else.  Now, let's use it as a Sprite.  

``` java
public class SpriteDemo2 extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createContent()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(1);
        BorderPane results = new BorderPane();
        results.setMinWidth(500);
        results.setMinHeight(400);
        ImageView sprite = new ImageView(this.getClass().getResource("Troll.png").toExternalForm());
        Button button = new Button("Click Me!");
        results.setCenter(sprite);
        results.setBottom(button);
        button.setOnAction(evt -> {
            int currentValue = indexProperty.get();
            indexProperty.set((currentValue < 9) ? currentValue + 1 : 1);
        });
        Rectangle2D viewPort = new Rectangle2D(0, 0, 100, 140);
        sprite.setViewport(viewPort);
        indexProperty.addListener(observable -> {
            int column = indexProperty.get() % 5;
            if (column == 0) {
                column = 5;
            }
            int xOffset = (column - 1) * 100;
            int yOffset = (indexProperty.get() / 5) * 150;
            sprite.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(xOffset, yOffset, 100, 140));
        });
        return results;
    }
}

```
The individual troll images occupy a 100 x 140 pixel space, so that's the size of or `ViewPort` rectangle.

Here we've added on `ObjectProperty<Integer>` to hold the index of the current troll image.  The `Button` "click" action just increments the value from 1 to 10 and then back around to start over.

There's an `InvalidationListener` on the `Property`, which handles the display swapping inside the Sprite.  Since there are two rows of trolls, there's a little bit of calculation to turn a single index number into a row and column.  There's also a 10 pixel gap between the rows, so the vertical offset needs to be a bit bigger than the image height.

Which gives this:

{% include video id="RDpIE_F6Whg" provider="youtube" %}


### How This Works

Now the `ImageView` has a `ViewPort` set on it.  Essentially, this is rectangular area of the `Image` in the `ImageView` which will be displayed on the screen.

![SpriteWindow 1]({{page.sprite_window1}})

And then we move the origin of the ViewPort rectangle over 1 troll to the right, like this:

![SpriteWindow 2]({{page.sprite_window2}})

Since the `ViewPort` is locked onto the screen in a single position, it looks to the user like the `Image` behind it is snapping around to put a new troll under the window.  

## Animating the Sprite

Animating the Sprite is just a matter of automating the changing of the index value in the `Property`.  The `InvalidationListener` doesn't need to be changed at all, although it has been split off into its own method to keep the layout code looking clean.

Instead of using `Button` clicks to trigger the change to the index value, we're going to use an `Animation`, which is the JavaFX tool for automating things like this.

The `Animation` that we're using is a `Transition`.  What `Transition` is going to do is to increment a `Double` counter from 0.0 to 1.0 over the time span of a cycle.  In this case the cycle is going to be 1,200 ms, or 1.2 s.  Periodically, it's going to fire the `interpolate()` method, passing the current value of the counter to it.  We don't know how often it's going to fire, but we can be fairly sure that it's going to be many, many times during the cycle.  

We need our `Transition` to turn these calls to `interpolate()` into a set of discrete changes to the `ViewPort` of our Sprite, evenly spaced out over the cycle.  To do this, we multiple the `Double` counter by the number of trolls inside the Sprite, and then take the integer value (which rounds down).  Since we have 10 trolls in the Sprite, this will yield an integer between 0 and 9, which we shift over to 1 -10 by adding 1.

Even if the `interpolate()` method is called 100 times before the index moves from 1 to 2, this won't trigger the `InvalidationListener` until it actually changes to 2.  And so on.   This turns the `interpolate()` calls into discrete events.

``` java
public class SpriteDemo3 extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createContent()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(1);
        BorderPane results = new BorderPane();
        results.setMinWidth(500);
        results.setMinHeight(400);
        ImageView sprite = new ImageView(this.getClass().getResource("Troll.png").toExternalForm());
        results.setCenter(sprite);
        setViewPort(sprite, 1);
        indexProperty.addListener(observable -> setViewPort(sprite, indexProperty.get()));
        createAnimation(indexProperty).play();
        return results;
    }

    private void setViewPort(ImageView sprite, int value) {
        int column = value % 5;
        if (column == 0) {
            column = 5;
        }
        int xOffset = (column - 1) * 100;
        int yOffset = (value <= 5) ? 0 : 155;
        sprite.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(xOffset, yOffset, 100, 140));
    }

    private Animation createAnimation(ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty) {
        Animation animation = new Transition() {

            private int oldValue = 99;

            {
                setCycleDuration(Duration.millis(1200));
                setInterpolator(Interpolator.LINEAR);
            }

            protected void interpolate(double frac) {
                int value = ((int) (frac * 10)) + 1;
                indexProperty.set(value);
            }
        };
        animation.setCycleCount(Animation.INDEFINITE);
        return animation;
    }
}
```

A key thing to notice here is that you need to use Linear interpolation, not the default interpolation.  Otherwise, he speeds up and slows down as it cycles, which is annoying (and took me a while to figure out).

# Scrolling Background

Now we're going to add a scrolling background to the application.  The background will be this image:

![Background]({{page.background}})

The important thing about this image is that the extreme right edge of the image is identical to the left edge, which means that we can paste a copy of it at either side and it will look like a continuous scene.  Even more importantly, the second half will be identical to the first half (obviously).

Now the technique is very similar to the one with the Sprites.  We'll create a rectangular `ViewPort`, and then move it across the image, a few pixels at a time.  Just like with the Sprites, since the `ViewPort` is fixed on the screen, it will look like the image is moving through the `ViewPort`, not the other way around.

## Infinite Scrolling

In order to handle the infinite scrolling aspect, we need to reset the offset every time the `ViewPort` is fully into the second half of the image:

![Background]({{page.background2}})

Here there's a big line showing the join between the images, and you can see how the part of image inside the blue `ViewPort` is identical to the content shown in the pink `ViewPort`.  So you can flip between the two of them and the user wouldn't see any difference.  This means that we can vary the X offset between 0 and the width of one of the images, resetting it back to zero each time, and it will look like a continuous scroll.

In reality, it would never get that far over to the right, you'll see...

Here's the code:

``` java
public class SpriteDemo4 extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createContent()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(1);
        ObjectProperty<Integer> backgroundOffsetProperty = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(0);

        ImageView sprite = new ImageView(this.getClass().getResource("Troll.png").toExternalForm());
        ImageView background = new ImageView(this.getClass().getResource("Background.png").toExternalForm());
        background.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(0, 0, 400, 238));
        setViewPort(sprite, 1);
        sprite.setTranslateY(50);
        indexProperty.addListener(observable -> setViewPort(sprite, indexProperty.get()));
        backgroundOffsetProperty.addListener(observable -> {
            background.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(backgroundOffsetProperty.get(), 0, 400, 238));
        });
        createSpriteAnimation(indexProperty).play();
        createBackgroundAnimation(backgroundOffsetProperty).play();
        StackPane results = new StackPane(background, sprite);
        results.setMinWidth(500);
        results.setMinHeight(400);
        return results;
    }

    private void setViewPort(ImageView sprite, int value) {
        int column = value % 5;
        if (column == 0) {
            column = 5;
        }
        int xOffset = (column - 1) * 100;
        int yOffset = (value <= 5) ? 0 : 155;
        sprite.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(xOffset, yOffset, 100, 140));
    }

    private Animation createSpriteAnimation(ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty) {
        Animation animation = new Transition() {

            private int oldValue = 99;

            {
                setCycleDuration(Duration.millis(900));
                setInterpolator(Interpolator.LINEAR);
            }

            protected void interpolate(double frac) {
                int value = ((int) (frac * 10)) + 1;
                if (value != oldValue) {
                    if (value == 11) {
                        value = 1;
                    }
                    oldValue = value;
                    indexProperty.set(value);
                }
            }
        };
        animation.setCycleCount(Animation.INDEFINITE);
        return animation;
    }

    private Animation createBackgroundAnimation(ObjectProperty<Integer> backgroundOffsetProperty) {
        Animation animation = new Transition() {
            {
                setCycleDuration(Duration.millis(36000));
                setInterpolator(Interpolator.LINEAR);
            }

            protected void interpolate(double frac) {
                int backgroundOffset = (int) ((frac * 6350)) % 635;
                backgroundOffsetProperty.set(backgroundOffset);
            }
        };
        animation.setCycleCount(Animation.INDEFINITE);
        return animation;
    }
}
```

This is very similar to the previous example, but we've swapped out the `BorderPane` for a `StackPane` since we want our running troll to be on top of the scrolling background.  We also had to apply a vertical translation to the troll so that his feet lined up with the grass at the bottom, so he didn't look like he was running in the air.

All of the scrolling is done be manipulating the offset `Property` in the `Animation`.  The 0.0 -> 1.0 `frac` is multiplied by an even multiple of the single image width (635 pixels), and then the modulo when divided by the single image width is taken as the new offset.  In this case, the multiplier is 6350, which means that each complete cycle of the `Transition` will go across the image 10 times.  In needs to be an even multiplier of the width so that the cycle ends at the right edge of the single image and the next cycle - starting at the left edge - will be a smooth transition.

The only trick here is getting the cycle times right for both `Animations`, so that the troll looks like he's running at the same speed as the background is moving.  Otherwise he looks like he's sliding.

Now it looks like this:

Now let's look at Sprites again...

# Multiple Image Sprites

When I started out writing this tutorial, I was under the impression that most Sprites were packaged up into single image files the way I've shown above.  But when I started looking for good example Sprites to use, I found that many of them are packaged up as individual images.  

In fact, this is the way that the trolls were packaged up - a Zip file with individual images.  I wasn't going to use them at first, but they are just too awesome *not* to use.  So I ended up creating a composite image Sprite file myself to show how that works.

But now, let's look at how to use individual files.  There were three different trolls in the Zip file, so let's use a different troll, but we'll stick to the "running" Sprites.

## The Technique

In many ways, this is simpler than the single image file Sprite.  There are ten images, all named "Run_00{x}.png", where the "x" is an index.  So we load them into a `Queue`.  At this point we aren't even really interested in the numbering of the images at all.  They are just a sequence that we'll rotate through.  To keep the `Queue` going, we add each `Image` that we remove from the `ImageView` to the end of the `Queue`, then load the one from the front into the `ImageView`.

I've kept the index `Property`, in part just to keep the separation between the layout and the animation control.  But the Listener doesn't even look at the value of the `Property`.  There *is* a call to `get()`, but it's just there to revalidate the `Property`.  However, the mechanics of the index `Property` still convert the continuum of values for `frac` into 10 discrete, fairly evenly spaced out, events.

``` java
public class SpriteDemo5 extends Application {
    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {
        primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(createContent()));
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(1);
        ObjectProperty<Integer> backgroundOffsetProperty = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(0);
        Queue<Image> imageQueue = getImages();
        ImageView sprite = new ImageView(imageQueue.remove());
        ImageView background = new ImageView(this.getClass().getResource("Background.png").toExternalForm());
        background.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(0, 0, 400, 238));
        sprite.setTranslateY(18);
        indexProperty.addListener(observable -> {
            indexProperty.get();
            changeTrollImage(sprite, imageQueue);
        });
        backgroundOffsetProperty.addListener(observable -> {
            background.setViewport(new Rectangle2D(backgroundOffsetProperty.get(), 0, 400, 238));
        });
        createSpriteAnimation(indexProperty).play();
        createBackgroundAnimation(backgroundOffsetProperty).play();
        StackPane results = new StackPane(background, sprite);
        results.setMinWidth(500);
        results.setMinHeight(400);
        return results;
    }

    private Queue<Image> getImages() {
        Queue<Image> imageQueue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
            URL url = this.getClass().getResource("Run_00" + x + ".png");
            imageQueue.add(new Image(url.toExternalForm(), 160.0, 0.0, true, true));
        }
        return imageQueue;
    }

    private void changeTrollImage(ImageView sprite, Queue<Image> imageQueue) {
        imageQueue.add(sprite.getImage());
        sprite.setImage(imageQueue.remove());
    }

    private Animation createSpriteAnimation(ObjectProperty<Integer> indexProperty) {
        Animation animation = new Transition() {
            {
                setCycleDuration(Duration.millis(900));
                setInterpolator(Interpolator.LINEAR);
            }

            protected void interpolate(double frac) {
                int value = ((int) (frac * 10));
                indexProperty.set(value);
            }
        };
        animation.setCycleCount(Animation.INDEFINITE);
        return animation;
    }

    private Animation createBackgroundAnimation(ObjectProperty<Integer> backgroundOffsetProperty) {
        Animation animation = new Transition() {
            {
                setCycleDuration(Duration.millis(36000));
                setInterpolator(Interpolator.LINEAR);
            }

            protected void interpolate(double frac) {
                int backgroundOffset = (int) ((frac * 6350)) % 635;
                backgroundOffsetProperty.set(backgroundOffset);
            }
        };
        animation.setCycleCount(Animation.INDEFINITE);
        return animation;
    }
}
```
One thing I did was to scale the `Images` to the correct size, rather than have the `ImageView` scale them for display.  This might make some difference in performance, but it's hard to tell with such a simple example.  In a busy screen with many Sprites, it could become important.  

I also scaled this troll a bit bigger than the last one.  So his vertical positioning needed adjustment.

It looks like this:

# Conclusion

I hope that you can see that both animated Sprites and scrolling backgrounds are fairly easy to implement in JavaFX.

Most Sprites are bundled up with a variety of different action sequences.  The trolls have walking, jumping, dying, running, attacking and idle.  Some others might have "firing", or "exploding".  I can see a strong case for packaging everything up into a single class that extends `ImageView`, and having methods to start up different animations.  So you could have a class called `Troll`, and then call `troll.run()`, or `troll.attack()` to trigger the appropriate animation.  That would allow you to have different kinds of trolls on the screen and your layout code wouldn't contain any of the mechanics about the animation - which would be very clean.
