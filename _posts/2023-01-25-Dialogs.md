# Introduction

We're all familiar with Dialog boxes, they pop up with some important information, ask you, "Are you sure?", let us pick a file, or make some other important decision before processing can continue.  In the beginning, JavaFX didn't have `Dialogs` and we were left to cook up our own solutions or use third party libraries.  But they were added around JavaFX 8, and work quite well.

There are places where a `Dialog` makes a lot of sense, but a lot of places where they result in a bad user experience.  First off, most users hate pop-ups and they're almost always a surprise when the appear.  So if you can design your UX such that whatever information would be in a `Dialog` is conveyed in your main GUI, your users will be happier.  For instance, instead of putting up a dialog that indicates that some `TextField` contains an invalid value, how about configuring your `TextField` so that the users cannot enter invalid data?  

The sample code in this article are written in Kotlin.  If you know Java, you should be able to figure out what the Kotlin code is doing with little trouble.  If you need a quick primer in Kotlin, you can check out my [article](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/kotlin/kotlin_for_java_programmers), which should tell you everything you need to know.

# The Basics

`Dialogs` really aren't that complicated, but this is one of those places where the JavaDocs is not a very good learning tool.  This means that beginners get confused about how to go about using them.  You'll need to understand how their layout works, the `ButtonType` madness, and then about "Result Converters".

Before we get into more advanced concepts, let's look at the core concepts about how `Dialog` works...

## Button Types

`ButtonTypes` is the concept that really gets beginners' heads spinning.  It's meant to abstract the *meaning* of the `Buttons` from the *implementation* of the `Buttons`, and make it easier to quickly implement a `Dialog`.  Because you don't have to worry about how the `Buttons` actually get on the screen, you can treat them like data through the `ButtonTypes`.  Of course, none of this is explained properly, so it just causes a lot of confusion.

Let's clear that up...

{% include notice type="primary" content="Dialogs are designed to be user interactions inserted into a procedural flow." %}

Very often, `Dialogs` are used to allow the user to make some kind of choice between a small number of options - which can even be something as simple as "proceed" or "stop".  To simplify the programming needed to implement these kinds of `Dialogs`, the designers of JavaFX have given us `ButtonTypes` and the `Enum` class `ButtonBar.ButtonData`.

`ButtonType` is a POJO with a set of statically predefined values that correspond to the values in `ButtonBar.ButtonData`.  These are values like `APPLY`, `OK`, `CANCEL` and `NEXT`.  You *can* make your own `ButtonTypes` if you want, and this allows you to have a button in your `Dialog` with a customized label but a standard value.  

If you're using `Dialogs` this way, then you don't add the `Buttons` directly to the `Dialog`, you just add a list of the `ButtonTypes` that you want to have, and the `Dialog` takes care of adding the `Buttons` in the right place, and then it will tell you the `ButtonType` of the `Button` that the user clicked.  There isn't any way to directly add a `Button` to the standard "Button Bar" in a `Dialog`.

## Handling Return Values

`Dialogs` are primarily intended to be used modally as part of a procedural flow.  "Modal" means that the window holding the `Dialog` is the only active window in the application, and the user cannot interact with any other part of your GUI until they have dismissed the `Dialog`.  The normal way to put a `Dialog` on the screen is to use `Dialog.showAndWait()`.

`Dialog.showAndWait()` is very special case in JavaFX coding.  It's almost like using a blocking operation in your code, which you would ordinarily never do on the FXAT.  However, `Dialog.showAndWait()` does **not** block the FXAT.  Events will continue to be processed on the FXAT, transitions and timers will continue to run, and the screen will continue to respond appropriately to window moves, mouse actions and keystrokes.  

What will happen, though, is that the code that contains the `Dialog.showAndWait()` call will stop.  No more code will be executed until the `Dialog` has been closed.  At that point, the execution will continue.  

And when the execution continues, the `Dialog.showAndWait()` call will have returned a value.  This value is wrapped in `Optional`, meaning that you'll have to check to see if there is an actual value.  The JavaDocs for `Dialog` show three methods to handle the `Optional` with the notation that, "There is no better or worse option of the three...".  That's utter rubbish.  The first approach uses `Optional.get()` which is an anti-pattern.  The third approach, "The fully lambda approach", is totally counter-intuitive, and probably inspired by the novelty of lambdas at the time that `Dialogs` were introduced.

Stick to `Optional.ifPresent()`, and if you want to have some code executed if there is no value returned you should use `Optional.ifPresentOrElse()`.

But why would `Dialog.showAndWait()` return an Optional?...

## Abnormal Closing of the Dialog

Since windows often have that "X" in the top corner, it's possible to close them without clicking on one of the `Buttons`.  This means that the `Dialog` can close without the user giving a response, and the way that is handled is to return the value as an `Optional`.

The JavaDocs refer to this as "abnormally" closing a `Dialog`.  Not all `Dialogs` can be closed this way, it depends on the nature of the `Buttons` in the `Dialog`.  

If a `Dialog` only has one `Button`, then it can be closed abnormally.  If a `Dialog` has more than one `Button`, and one of those `Buttons` has been defined as a "Cancel" `Button`, then it can also be closed abnormally.

In the standard implementation of `Dialogs`, the "Cancel" `Button` is usually treated the same as an abnormal close, and the `Dialog` will return an empty `Optional`.

# Dialog Utility Subtypes

There are three subtypes of `Dialog`, each intended to make it easy to perform specific types of common user interaction...

## Alert

Alerts are intended to send a message to the user and require them to acknowledge it before moving on.  Control of how the `Alert` will look is by assigning an `AlertType` to it.  Beyond that, you can change the window title, the text which appears beside the icon, the message and the icon itself.  `Alert` extends `Dialog<ButtonType>` which means that its `showAndWait()` method will return `Optional<ButtonType>`

### The AlertTypes and How They Look

The JavaDocs don't give much help about what the different `AlertTypes` actually do, just some generic description of their intended uses.  The only way to see is to try them, so here's some Kotlin code that will do the trick:

``` kotlin
class AlertTest : Application() {
   override fun start(primaryStage: Stage) {
      primaryStage.setScene(Scene(createContent()))
      primaryStage.show()
   }

   private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
      center = Button("Click Me").apply {
         onAction = EventHandler {
            val alert = Alert(AlertType.CONFIRMATION).apply {
               contentText = "Click a Button"
            }
            alert.showAndWait().ifPresentOrElse({ println("This is the result: $it") }, { println("No result") })
         }
      }
      padding = Insets(50.0)
   }
}

fun main() {
   Application.launch(AlertTest::class.java)
}
```
From this code I generated the following screen snaps, changing the AlertType each time...


AlertType.Confirmation:

![Confirmation Alert]({{page.alert_confirmation}})

This is the only AlertType that generates more than one button, and abnormally closing it will return a "Cancel" value.  The idea behind this `Alert` is usually to allow the user one last chance to abort an operation before it starts.

The next three don't differ in functionality, just the presentation of the message...

AlertType.Error:

![Error Alert]({{page.alert_error}})

AlertType.Information:

![Information Alert]({{page.alert_information}})

AlertType.Warning:

![Warning Alert]({{page.alert_warning}})

AlertType.None:

![Empty Alert]({{page.alert_none}})

This `AlertType` is useless without some further customization.  In fact, it isn't even possible to close this `Dialog` at all since there are no `Buttons` which means it won't accept an abnormal closing either.

Here's how you can customize it:

``` kotlin
val alert = Alert(AlertType.NONE).apply {
   contentText = "This is contentText"
   headerText = "This is headerText"
   title = "This is the title"
   buttonTypes += listOf(ButtonType.APPLY, ButtonType.FINISH)
   graphic = AlertTest::class.java.getResource("/images/boom.png")?.toExternalForm()?.run { ImageView(this) }?.apply {
      fitWidth = 60.0
      isPreserveRatio = true
   }
}
```
And that gives you this:

![Custom Alert]({{page.alert_custom}})

Of course, you can apply all of these customizations to any of the `AlertTypes`.

## TextInputDialog

`TextInputDialog` looks very much like an `Alert` set to `AlertType.CONFIRMATION`, except that it also has a `TextField` placed into the content.  This is intended to be a very quick way to set up a straight-forward input `Dialog` with a minimun of extraneous code.

Here's a simple example:

``` kotlin
private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
   center = Button("Click Me").apply {
      onAction = EventHandler {
         val dialog = TextInputDialog("This is the default").apply {
            contentText = "This is a message in\n the content text"
            headerText = "Input Required"
         }
         dialog.showAndWait().ifPresentOrElse({ println("This is the result: $it") }, { println("No result") })
      }
   }
   padding = Insets(50.0)
}
```

Which looks like this:

![TextInputDialog]({{page.textinputdialog}})

`TextInputDialog` extends `Dialog<String>` so it will return an `Optional<String>`.  The result will be empty if the user clicks the "Cancel" `Button` or abnormally closes the window.  Otherwise it will return the value that is in the TextField.

In addition to the customization values available with `Alert` you can also get access to the `TextField` contained in the `Dialog` via `TextInputDialog.getEditor()`.  This means that you can install a [TextFormatter](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/javafx/elements/textformatter/) on it.


## ChoiceDialog

Like `TextInputDialog`, `ChoiceDialog` is inteded to be a "no fuss" way to set up an input `Dialog`, but using a `ComboBox` instead of a `TextField`.  You'll need to provide the list of possible choices, as well as the default...

``` kotlin
private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
   val button = Button("Click Me").apply {
      onAction = EventHandler {
         val dialog = ChoiceDialog<String>("Wombat", "Bunny", "Wombat", "Kangaroo", "Panda").apply {
            contentText = "This is a message in\n the content text"
            headerText = "Input Required"
         }
         dialog.showAndWait().ifPresentOrElse({ println("This is the result: $it") }, { println("No result") })
      }
   }
   center = button
   padding = Insets(50.0)
}
```
Which looks like this:

![ChoiceDialog]({{page.choicedialog}})

Unlike `TextInputDialog`, you cannot grab the input control to customize it.  You can, however, still customize the other common elements just like the other standard `Dialogs`.  

# Creating Your Own Dialog

While `Alert`, `TextInputDialog` and `ChoiceDialog` are likely to satisfy 90%+ of your use cases for `Dialogs`, there are times when you'll need to create something a little bit more complicated and customized.  So let's look at how you go about doing that...

## DialogPane

{% include notice type="primary" content="The Dialog class is NOT a screen component.  It's best thought of as a controller class." %}

The screen content of a `Dialog` is a class called `DialogPane`, which handles the layout.  It has four main components, the "Header", the "Content", the "Expandable Content" and the "Button Bar".  If you've looked at the screen shots of `TextInputDialog` or `ChoiceDialog` earlier in this article then you've seen how this structure works.  

### The "Header" Section

The "Header" section contains two elements; some text and a graphic.  These are actually two different `Nodes`, not the text and graphic of a `Labeled` type of `Node`.  You can change the content of either of these two `Nodes` directly if you want.  Often, the graphic is an `ImageView`, but you can change it to any kind of `Node` that you like.

You can directly change the values held in the default `Nodes`:

setHeaderText()
: This will update the text content of the "Header" section.

setGraphic()
: This will update the content of the graphic in the "Header" section.  You can put any kind of `Node` in here.

These are also `Properties` so you can do the usual binding stuff if that makes sense for your application.

But if you want a completely custom "Header" section...

setHeader()
: This will replace the entire "Header" section with your own `Node`.  Once you have done this, you will not be able to use `setHeaderText()` or `setGraphic()`.

If you haven't called `setHeader()` to implement your own custom header `Node`, then calling `getHeader()` will return `Null`.  In other words, you cannot use `getHeader()` to retrieve and manipulate the default header `Node`.

### The "Content" Section

The "Content" section is occupied by an empty `Label` by default.  You can update its text value directly.

setContentText()
: This will update the text value in the "Content" section.  

This is also a `Property` so you can do the usual binding stuff if that makes sense for your application.
This looks like this:

If you decide that you do not like the default `Label` implementation for the "Content" section you may replace it with your own `Node`...

setContent()
: This will replace the entire "Content" section with your own `Node`.  Once you have done this, you will not be able to use `setContentText()` any more.

If you haven't called `setContent()` to implement your own custom content `Node`, then calling `getContent()` will return `Null`.  In other words, you cannot use `getContent()` to retrieve and manipulate the default content `Node`.

### The "Expandable Content" Section

If you have additional details that users may not always need/want to see, you can put it into the "Expandable Content" section.  Unlike the "Header" and the "Content" sections, you cannot access a text value for it, you have to supply a `Node` via the `setExpandableContent()` method.  

If this `Node` is non-null, then a "twisty" style arrow with the text, "Show Details" will appear in the "Button Bar".  Clicking on it will expand the `Dialog` size, and display the `Node` contained in the "Expandable Content" section.  The "twisty" changes to say "Hide Details".

### The "Button Bar"

The "Button Bar" really is a `ButtonBar` and it sits at the bottom of the `DialogPane`.  There's no way to directly access it, and the only way to add or remove buttons is to add new `ButtonTypes` to the list from `getButtonTypes()`.

### Delegate Methods in Dialog

There are convenience delegate methods in the `Dialog` class which call the appropriate method in `DialogPane` to modify all three of the content values.  These are the setters and getters for `contentText`, `headerText` and `graphic`.  To actually change the `Nodes` for any of these elements from the defaults (or to access the default `Nodes`) you'll have to get the `DialogPane` from the `Dialog` first.  

For some unfathomable reason, there's no delegate method in `Dialog` to retrieve the list of `ButtonTypes`.  So, once again, you'll have to grab the `DialogPane` first.  

### A Sample

Here's the code for a customized `Dialog` with the default `Nodes` for the "Header" and "Content" sections, but with the values populated.  There's a single `Button` and "Expandable Content":

``` kotlin
private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
      val button = Button("Click Me").apply {
         onAction = EventHandler {
            val dialog = Dialog<ButtonType>().apply {
               contentText = "This is a message in\n the content text"
               headerText = "The HeaderText"
               title = "Dialog Title"
               graphic = this::class.java.getResource("/images/boom.png")?.toExternalForm()?.run { ImageView(this) }?.apply {
                  fitWidth = 40.0
                  isPreserveRatio = true
               }
               dialogPane.buttonTypes += ButtonType.CLOSE
               dialogPane.expandableContent = Label("""This is the expandable content
                  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
                   Integer tristique malesuada arcu a malesuada. Ut porta
                   et mauris eu pellentesque. Curabitur molestie vel nunc vitae pharetra.
                   In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Donec ut rutrum mauris. In hac habitasse platea dictumst.
                   Donec tristique ac nisl pretium suscipit. Morbi magna quam, convallis ut vehicula et,
                   lacinia nec orci. Quisque commodo neque vitae finibus malesuada. Integer a magna ultricies,
                   consequat velit sit amet, laoreet purus. Pellentesque facilisis aliquam tortor eu eleifend.
                  """)
            }
            dialog.showAndWait().ifPresentOrElse({ println("This is the result: $it") }, { println("No result") })
         }
      }
      center = button
      padding = Insets(50.0)
   }
```

This looks like this:

![Custom Dialog Unexpanded]({{page.customdialog1}})

And expanded it looks like this:

![Custom Dialog Expanded]({{page.customdialog2}})

## Styling

Here's the `Modena.css` entries for `Dialog`.  It will point you to the correct strategy to customize the styling of your `Dialog`:

``` css
/*******************************************************************************
 *                                                                             *
 * Dialog                                                                      *
 *                                                                             *
 ******************************************************************************/

.dialog-pane {
    -fx-background-color: -fx-background;
    -fx-padding: 0;
}

.dialog-pane > .expandable-content {
    -fx-padding: 0.666em; /* 8px */
}

.dialog-pane > .button-bar > .container {
    -fx-padding: 0.833em; /* 10px */
}

.dialog-pane > .content.label {
    -fx-alignment: top-left;
    -fx-padding: 1.333em 0.833em 0 0.833em; /* 16px 10px 0px 10px */
}

.dialog-pane > .content {
    -fx-padding: 0.833em; /* 10 */
}

.dialog-pane:no-header .graphic-container {
    -fx-padding: 0.833em 0 0 0.833em; /* 10px 0px 0px 10px */
}

.dialog-pane:header .header-panel {
    /*-fx-padding: 0.833em 1.166em 0.833em 1.166em; *//* 10px 14px 10px 14px */
    -fx-padding: 0.833em; /* 10px */
    -fx-background-color: -fx-box-border, linear-gradient(-fx-background, derive(-fx-background, 30%));
    -fx-background-insets: 0, 0 0 1 0;
}

.dialog-pane:header .header-panel .label {
    -fx-font-size: 1.167em; /* 14px */
    -fx-wrap-text: true;
}

.dialog-pane:header .header-panel .graphic-container {
    /* This prevents the text in the header running directly into the graphic */
    -fx-padding: 0 0 0 0.833em; /* 0px 0px 0px 10px */
}

.dialog-pane > .button-bar > .container > .details-button {
  -fx-alignment: baseline-left;
  -fx-focus-traversable: false;
  -fx-padding: 0.416em; /* 5px */
}

.dialog-pane > .button-bar > .container > .details-button.more {
    -fx-graphic: url("dialog-more-details.png");
}

.dialog-pane > .button-bar > .container > .details-button.less {
    -fx-graphic: url("dialog-fewer-details.png");
}

.dialog-pane > .button-bar > .container > .details-button:hover {
    -fx-underline: true;
}
```

You can see that all of the stylings are applied to sub-components of `DialogPane`, and that you have separate entries for the header, the content, the expandable content and the button bar.  

The best strategy for customizing these is to create a separate style class selector for your `Dialog` and then add it to the `DialogPane` of your `Dialog`.  You don't have to customize the base style class you've added, but you can add in entries for the sub-components that you want.  

This was added to `default.css`:

``` css
.fancy-alert > .content {
   -fx-background-color: lightblue;
}
```

We're just adding a light blue background to the "Content" area of the `Dialog`

``` kotlin
private fun createDialog() = Alert(AlertType.CONFIRMATION).apply {
   this::class.java.getResource("/css/default.css")?.toString()?.let { dialogPane.stylesheets += it }
   contentText = "This is a sample message"
   dialogPane.styleClass += "fancy-alert"
}
```

{% include notice type= "primary" content= " Dialogs open in their own Scene, so they won't inherit any style sheets that you've added to your main GUI screen." %}

You'll have add your stylesheet to the `DialogPane` which is the *root* `Node` of the `Scene` it opens in.  

This results in this:

![Styled Alert]({{page.styledalert}})

This isn't pretty, but it does show that the content area has been styled.  If you replace the standard `Nodes` for any of the areas, then you can directly add style classes to your custom `Nodes`, with the caveat that you'll still need to add the stylesheet to the `DialogPane`.

## The Result Converter

You may have noticed that the `TextInputDialog` and `ChoiceDialog` do not return `Optional<ButtonType>`.  `TextInputDialog` returns `Optional<String>` and `ChoiceDialog` is a generic class, return `Optional<T>` where `T` is whatever type you declared your `ChoiceDialog` to be.  

So how does `Dialog` do this?

It uses something called a "Result Converter".

{% include notice type= "primary" content= "Understanding how to implement your own Result Converter is the key to creating custom Dialogs that do more interesting things." %}

A Result Converter is a `Callback`.  A `Callback` is a functional interface that's usually invoked deep within some standard element to allow it to do something customized.  It's essentially a "hook" for you to tie in your own code that will be called at some standard place.  That standard element will "call back" to your code to figure out some value for it.

Technically, a Result Converter is of type `Callback<ButtonType, R>`.  This means that it will be passed a `ButtonType` and it will return a value of type `R`, and that `R` is going to be the same `R` that you declared your `Dialog` to be.  You just have to supply the code that says, "Ok, the user clicked `ButtonType.DoIt` so I need to return this value...".  

## A Simple Custom Dialog Example

Now let's say we've written some process that could possibly terminate badly in some way.  We've captured the crash, and we need to have the user specify how to proceed from here:

![Dialog With Conversion]({{page.converteddialog1}})

Here we have three custom `ButtonTypes`, and we need to convert the button that's clicked into something that's meaningful to process that's generated the `Dialog`.  In this case we're going to us the Enum `RecoveryAction` that we've created.  So we're going to use a `Dialog<RecoveryAction>`....

``` kotlin
class CustomDialogExample : Application() {
   override fun start(primaryStage: Stage) {
      primaryStage.setScene(Scene(createContent()))
      primaryStage.show()
   }

   private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
      val button = Button("Click Me").apply {
         onAction = EventHandler {
            createDialog().showAndWait().ifPresentOrElse({ println("This is the result: $it") }, { println("No result") })
         }
      }
      center = button
      padding = Insets(50.0)
   }

   private fun createDialog() = Dialog<RecoveryAction>().apply {
      val dump = "Core Dump"
      val support = "Contact Support"
      val ignore = "Who Cares?"
      resultConverter = Callback { buttonType ->
         when (buttonType.text) {
            dump -> RecoveryAction.CORE_DUMP
            support -> RecoveryAction.CALL_SUPPORT
            ignore -> RecoveryAction.IGNORE
            else -> null
         }
      }
      headerText = "The Program has Bombed"
      title = "Oops!!!"
      graphic = this::class.java.getResource("/images/boom.png")?.toExternalForm()?.run { ImageView(this) }?.apply {
         fitWidth = 40.0
         isPreserveRatio = true
      }
      dialogPane.buttonTypes += listOf(ButtonType(dump), ButtonType(support), ButtonType(ignore))
      contentText = """Something horrible has happened.
Now you need to pick how you would like to handle the issue.
                     """
   }
}

enum class RecoveryAction { CORE_DUMP, CALL_SUPPORT, IGNORE }

fun main() {
   Application.launch(CustomDialogExample::class.java)
}

This is a very straight-forward use of the `ButtonType` -> `RecoveryAction` result converter.  We just check the text associated with the `ButtonType` that the user clicked, and convert that into the Enum.  Usually, the idea of using the text on the `Button` is a pretty horrible idea, but `ButtonType` doesn't give a lot of options if you want to use the `Buttons` to select the action.  

### A More Integrated Example

As you've seen from `TextInputDialog` and `ChoiceDialog`, it's possible to put data collection `Nodes` into `Dialog` and then access them from your Result Converter to return something that's not just dependent on the `Button` that was clicked.  This opens up a whole world of possibilities, as your `Dialog` can now contain all manner of layouts and can work just like any screen, and then you can gather up results and pass them on to your process.  

Let's move the choice from the `Buttons` and into the content of the `Dialog`.  In this case, we'll use `RadioButtons`:

![Converted Dialog With RadioButtons]({{page.converteddialog2}})

Unlike the previous version, it's now possible to have an empty answer, because we have two buttons and one of them is a "Cancel" type.  You can see that when that happens, we just return `Null` from the result converter.  In the result converter, we check the `ToggleGroup` to see which `RadioButton` was selected.  This all works because the Result Converter and the `RadioButtons` and the `ToggleGroup` were all defined in the same scope...

``` kotlin
class CustomDialogExample : Application() {
   override fun start(primaryStage: Stage) {
      primaryStage.setScene(Scene(createContent()))
      primaryStage.show()
   }

   private fun createContent(): Region = BorderPane().apply {
      val button = Button("Click Me").apply {
         onAction = EventHandler {
            createDialog().showAndWait().ifPresentOrElse({ println("This is the result: $it") }, { println("No result") })
         }
      }
      center = button
      padding = Insets(50.0)
   }

   private fun createDialog() = Dialog<RecoveryAction>().apply {
      val dumpRB = RadioButton("Core Dump")
      val supportRB = RadioButton("Contact Support")
      val ignoreRB = RadioButton("Who Cares?")
      val toggleGroup = ToggleGroup().apply {
         toggles += listOf<Toggle>(dumpRB, supportRB, ignoreRB)
      }
      dialogPane.content = FlowPane(dumpRB, supportRB, ignoreRB).apply {
         hgap = 20.0
      }
      resultConverter = Callback { buttonType ->
         if (buttonType == ButtonType.OK) {
            when (toggleGroup.selectedToggle) {
               dumpRB -> RecoveryAction.CORE_DUMP
               supportRB -> RecoveryAction.CALL_SUPPORT
               ignoreRB -> RecoveryAction.IGNORE
               else -> null
            }
         } else null
      }
      headerText = "The Program has Bombed"
      title = "Oops!!!"
      graphic = this::class.java.getResource("/images/boom.png")?.toExternalForm()?.run { ImageView(this) }?.apply {
         fitWidth = 40.0
         isPreserveRatio = true
      }
      dialogPane.buttonTypes += listOf(ButtonType.CLOSE, ButtonType.OK)
      dialogPane.expandableContent = Label("""Something horrible has happened.
Now you need to pick how you would like to handle the issue.
                     """)
   }
}

enum class RecoveryAction { CORE_DUMP, CALL_SUPPORT, IGNORE }

fun main() {
   Application.launch(CustomDialogExample::class.java)
}
```
Since we have some actual content in the `Dialog`, the text description has been moved into the "Expanded Content" area.  

This is still a pretty simple example, but you should be able to see that you could use the "Content" section of a `Dialog` as the View in an MVCI framework.  You can have a Model and the Result Converter would be a method call in your Interactor.  The Controller would be responsible for instantiating the actual `Dialog` and pass that back through `getView()`.  If you did something like that, then the sky's the limit for the kind of things that you could put into a `Dialog`.

# Summary

`Dialogs` are primarily useful in two ways:

1. When you have a process that needs to be interrupted to interact with the user.
1. When you some kind of supplementary data entry that you don't want to clutter your main GUI.

Of the two, the first is probably the most common.  When you just need to send a message to the user, then your best route is to use one of the `Alert` versions of `Dialog`.  When you need more complicated data collection from the user, then you're probably going to have to design a custom `Dialog` to do the work.
